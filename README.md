Project:

Attempt to recreate the typing text I used in the react portfolio with just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and no installed package

Technologies: See above

Initial thoughts:

converting string to array, then manipulating the elements of that array with interval and input into HTML dynamically

What worked:

TBD

Update:

I will rate it as succesful. Used setTimeout instead of setInterval.

Though I consider it a success, in an actual project, I would probably go a different route, as in this one, the animation is jerky, and there is a serious lag in speed control.
